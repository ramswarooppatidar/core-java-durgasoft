 * homogenious, fixed size
   in array no underline method is vaiable, like araylist
    Collection :
    an array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogenious data elements, 
    the main advantage of array is we can represent multiple values by using single varible
    so that readability of code will be increase,
    
    limitaton of aarays:
    1) arrays are fixed in size, once we ceate an array there is no cance of incresing or dec size
    based on over requiremnt, dueto this to use array concept complsury we should know size in advatnce
    which ma not possible always
    2) array can hold only homogenious data type elements
    3) array concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure and hence redimated method
    support is not availble, for every requirment we have to write the code , explacitly which increase
    complexity of programming
    4)to overcome above problems we should go for collection concept
    
    5)Collection are growable in nature, based on our requirment we can increse or decre the size
    collection can hold both homogenious and hetrogenous elements,
    every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structre, hence for every requiremnt
    redimate method support is availbe, 
    beign a programming we are responsible to use those methods and we are not responsible to implements
    those method
    
    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARRAYS AND COLLECTIONS:
    
    1)array are fixed in size || collection are growable in nature
    2)wrt to memory array are not recommonded to use ||  wrt to memory collection are  recommended to use
    3)wrt to performance araay are recommended touse || wrt to performance collection are not recommended to use
    4) arrays can hold only homogenious data type only || collection can hold both homogenious and hetrogenious
     
    5) there is no underline data structure for arrys and hence redimate method support is not availble for evry 
    requmenr
    we have write code explicity which increse complexity of programming   || evrry collection clas is implemented 
    based on some standard data sturcture and hence for evry requirment redimate method support is availble beign
    a programmer we use this method directly and we are not responsible to implement those methods 
    
    6) arrays can hold both premitive nad object || collection can hold only object
    
    
    COLLECTION :
    if we want to represent a group of indivisual object in single entity then we should go for collection
    
    COLLECTION FREAMWORK :
    it conatins several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a groupof individual object
    as a single entity

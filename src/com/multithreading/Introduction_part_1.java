		/*MULTI-TASKING
		 * executing sevral task, simultaniously is aconcept of multi tasking, there are two type of 
		 * multi tasking
		 * 1 process based multi tasking
		 * 2 thread based multi tasking
		 * 
		 *  PROCESS BASED MULTITASKING
		 *  executing servral task simulataniously where is task is seprate independent process
		 *  is called process based multi tasking
		 *  ex : 
 			typing, a java programm in the editor, 
		 *  we can listaen audio sound from same system
		 *  at the same time we can download a file from net, all this task will be executed
		 *  simulataniosly and independent of each othere, hence it is process based multi tasking
		 *  process based multi tasking is based suitable at OS lavel
		 *  
		 *  THREAD BASED MULTI-TASKING
		 *  executing several task simulataniously, where each task is separte independent path of the
		 *  same program is called, thread based multi tsking and each independen path is called thread
		 *  thrad basedd multi taksing is based suitable at programatic level
		 *  
		 *  
		 *  wheter it is process based or thread based the main objective of multi tasking is
		 *  to reduce RESPONSE TIME  of the sytem and to improve PERFORMANCE
		 *  
		 *  THE MAIN IMPORTANR AREA OF MULTI THREADING 
		 *  to develop multi media graphics
		 *  to develop animation
		 *  to develop vedio game
		 *  to develop web servers and application serbverse etc..
		 *  
		 *  When compaired with old language developing multi threding application in java is very easy
		 *  java provide inuilt support for multi threading with reach api(thread, Runable, threadGroup)
